Problem Statement â€“ Sub Sandwich Shop

Georgia Sub Shop is now offering customizable sub sandwiches. Customers can choose a base sandwich and add various ingredients such as meats, cheeses, and vegetables.

To support ongoing promotions and flexible discount strategies (e.g., Student Discount, Loyalty Discount), you are to implement the software using the Visitor Pattern.

Each discount is implemented as a Visitor and can be applied to the entire sandwich or specific components. For example:

Students get 10% off meats and cheese.

Loyalty members get $0.50 off the entire sandwich if the total is over $5.00.
